description: The anti-framework static site generator
---

PicoSSG is a minimal static site generator built on the philosophy of simplicity and predictability. 
It processes your markdown, nunjucks templates, and static files into a clean, static website with no configuration (unless you need it).

One of PicoSSG's most valuable features is its predictable 1:1 mapping from source to output.
