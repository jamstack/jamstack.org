Doctave is an opinionated documentation site generator that converts your Markdown files into a
beautiful documentation site with minimal effort.

Doctave is not a generic static site generator - it is only meant for generating documentation sites
from Markdown. This allows the tool to be much simpler than other solutions, with fewer
configuration steps.

This open source tool is built and maintained by [Doctave.com](https://www.doctave.com).

## Features
Doctave comes with a number of documentation-specific features out of the box. No plugins needed.

* Mermaid.js diagrams
* Offline full-text search
* Local live-reloading server
* Responsive design
* Dark mode
* GitHub flavored markdown
* Minimal configuration
* Builds your site in milliseconds (Doctave is built with Rust)
