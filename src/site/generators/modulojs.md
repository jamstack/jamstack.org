**The lightest, dependency-free way to start a Jamstack project:**

```
npm init modulo
```

Say goodbye to slow builds and heavy dependencies, `node_modules`, and build
servers: Get work done without that!

[Documentation on Modulo Jamstack is available here.](https://modulojs.org/tutorial/building-apps/part1.html)


The Moduolo.js Jamstack template includes: Netlify / Decap CMS ready-to-go,
most of the features you'd expect with React.js or Vue.js, including state,
props, directives, templating, data binding and reactive forms, templating,
global store and sub/pub, hydration, DOM reconciliation tools, and more, **all
with zero dependencies** save for the 2000 line file. The integrated Markdown,
Decap CMS, Netlify-safe SSR, and is already setup, with local or `unpkg`-based
dependencies.
