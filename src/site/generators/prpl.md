description: A modular static site generator built for longevity
---

PRPL is a modular static site generator built for longevity. It lets you interpolate content with a single HTML element.

## Why?

All the static site generators I have tried have one or more of these problems:

<br>

- Built on an underlying framework like React, Vue, etc.
- Relies on complex build tools like Webpack, Babel, etc.
- Depends on a massive tree of modules that force constant maintenance
- Has interfaces, source code and documentation that cannot be understood in one sitting
- Requires that your site source be organized in a way that looks nothing like your output
- Forces a huge leap from hello world to a real world implementation

<br>

PRPL is my answer to these gripes.

## Features

- HTML-based API compliant with web standards
- Command line, CommonJS and ECMAScript module interfaces
- Source code that is fully typed, explicitly commented and readable in one sitting
- Library architecture for modular adoption
- Minimally invasive, removable in seconds
- Opt-out of client side JavaScript entirely
- Define your own template syntax
