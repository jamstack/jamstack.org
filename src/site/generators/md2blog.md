description: A zero-config static site generator for dev blogs
---

**md2blog** is a zero-config static site generator for dev blogs. Spend less time fiddling with configuration files or themes and more time documenting your programming (mis)adventures!

Features:

* Ships in a **single self-contained binary**
* **Relative links** between Markdown files "just work" (and are checked at build time)
* **Posts are automatically tagged** and indexed based on the parent directory name
* **Syntax highlighting** works out of the box
* Generates an **Atom feed** automatically
* Typically generates only **a few kilobytes of HTML and CSS** (and no JavaScript)
* Comes with a built-in test server that **automatically reloads** pages when files are modified
