description: A fun little Static Site Generator with a Java soul and Quarkus energy.
---

Static site generator written in Java and leveraging the power of Quarkus.

### Features

Knowing that you don’t need to learn Quarkus or Java to use Roq, consider the following advantages:

- **Quarkus-based:** Since Roq is just a very thin layer on top of Quarkus, it ensures that the tool stays up to date and benefits from the robust support provided by the Quarkus ecosystem.
- **For everyone:** It is very easy to use with any level of knowledge. You can start with an existing theme (as a dependency) and only write Markdown or Asciidoc content, or customize everything.
- **Reproducibility Across Platforms:** Unlike some other SSG, Roq offers better reproducibility across multiple platforms, ensuring more consistent and predictable results when building or deploying.
- **Easy to maintain:** Managing dependencies and updates is easier with Roq thanks to Quarkus. Other systems such as Go or Ruby can be difficult to maintain and make reproducible across environments.
- **Speed:** Roq is using Quarkus for dev and build. Quarkus is famous for being supersonic and subatomic, with one example showing a Roq site build in just 20 milliseconds, greatly reducing build times compared to traditional generators.
- **Type Safety (via Qute templates):** Roq leverages Quarkus Qute’s type safety in templates and posts, making it easier to handle links, data injection, and other dynamic content with confidence.
- **Local Development Experience:** Roq provides a smoother local development experience without the need to "test in production," as is often necessary with other SSGs due to its difficulties in running locally.
- **Code Completion:** Thanks to Qute, Roq offers code completion, which is beneficial when working in templates, helping to reduce errors and improve developer productivity.
