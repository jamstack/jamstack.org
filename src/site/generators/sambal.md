As the web continue to evolve, metadata is becoming just as important as html itself.  Sambal natively supports [schema.org](https://schema.org/) [json-ld](https://json-ld.org/) so you can build SEO website directly from schema.org json-ld data.

## Features

- Auto generate Facebook, Twitter, and application/ld+json meta tags
- Build UI themes based on the semantic meaning of your data
- Leverage the power of linked data.  Unlike plain old json, json-ld can reference other data fragments with a url just like linking to another webpage with a hyperlink
- Publish HTML and schema.org json-ld files
- Auto convert image to schema.org ImageObject
