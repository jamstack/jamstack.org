Mandy is a light and fast static-site generator written in Rust. She tries
to make the experience of creating and managing content a joyful experience.
Mandy keeps things simple and is flexible by supporting a multitude of possible 
configuration languages and using Liquid for templating layouts
and Markdown for writing content. A site running Mandy can be found [here](https://alyxshang.boo).
The source code of that site can be found [here](https://github.com/alyxshang/alyxshang.boo).
