Mandy is an easy-to-use, highly customizable, hypersonic static-site generator. 
Mandy takes an opinionated approach to how an SSG-based site should be structured and does this well.
This little doll is still growing up, so she is still under active development.

If you want to contribute, you are more than welcome to.

I, [@angeldollface](https://github.com/angeldollface) am the sole developer(ess) of this project. 
Mandy is my brainchild.
