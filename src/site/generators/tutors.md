## The project supports three complimentary perspectives

### The Learner Experience (LX)

The Learner Experience prioritises web interactions that are engaging, contextual, linkable, searchable, accessible & responsive. In addition, the experience should foster a sense of community and connection among fellow learners.

### The Educator Experience (EX)

The Educator Experience prioritises the creation of guided paths through a curriculum via the creation of learning materials that are autonomous, structurally aligned, composable, auditable, extensible, versioned & independent.

### The Developer Experience (DX)

The Developer Experience proiritises the specification and implementation of robust, well documented, loosely coupled components & services, integrated into a coherent toolkit open to contributions from diverse skill sets.
