description: A simple, functional, hackable static site generator that gives authors the ability to treat websites as Scheme programs.
---

By giving authors the full expressive power of Scheme, they are able
to control every aspect of the site generation process. Haunt provides
a simple, functional build system that can be easily extended for this
purpose.

Haunt has no opinion about what markup language authors should use to
write posts, though it comes with support for the popular Markdown
format. Likewise, Haunt has no opinion about how authors structure
their sites. Though it comes with support for building simple blogs or
Atom feeds, authors should feel empowered to tweak, replace, or create
builders to do things that aren't provided out-of-the-box.
