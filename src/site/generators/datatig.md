DataTig helps you crowdsource and use data stored in files in a git repository.

The website you are currently reading does just that - all the data for https://jamstack.org/generators is stored in files in https://github.com/jamstack/jamstack.org/tree/main/src/site/generators :-)

DataTig provides tools to load data, check for errors and build a static web site. 

This static web site will help people browse and get the data and even contribute data of their own back.
