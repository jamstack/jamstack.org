YOCaml is a framework used to describe build systems in [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/), released under GPL3 license, with an API suited for creating static site generators. 

Unlike [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), which provide a CLI, YOCaml is closer to [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), as it imposes **no structure**,requiring you to build your generator step by step. 

This offers the opportunity to create diverse projects.
