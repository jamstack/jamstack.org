Fresh is a next generation web framework, built for speed, reliability, and simplicity. Some stand out features:

- Just-in-time rendering on the edge.
- Island based client hydration for maximum interactivity.
- Zero runtime overhead: no JS is shipped to the client by default.
- No build step.
- No configuration necessary.
- TypeScript support out of the box.

Fresh embraces the tried and true design of server side rendering and progressive enhancement on the client side.
