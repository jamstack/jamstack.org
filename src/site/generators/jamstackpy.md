Also known as Jamstackpy, Jamstack offers a scalable, easy to extend and fully customizable environment to create your static websites using all the power of Python and Flask, as simple or complex as you want.

You have the opportunity to start your site from scratch or use one of our wonderful templates courtesy of html5up.

## Installation

`$ python -m pip install jamstack`


## Create basic project

`$ jamstack plain <foldername>`


## Templates

Jamstack has templates available courtesy of [html5up](https://html5up.net). For see full templates visit Jamstack repo.

The syntax is as follows:


`$ jamstack t <template> <foldername>`

Use the `--existing` flag if you want the project to be created in an existing folder.


`$ jamstack t html5up/massively myproject --existing`


By default, projects are created without the assets (stylesheets, images, etc...) to download them, you must pass the `--jamdo` option to the `static.py` file of the respective project.

## Build

To build the site run the file `static.py`.

`$ python static.py`

Your site will be generated in the **dist/** folder.

Alternatively you can use the `--server` flag if you want to start livewatch.
