description: A site generation tool (and then some) for .NET platforms.
---

A simple, pluggable site generation tool for .NET developers and Windows users (with Mono support planned I think)

Pretzel follows the same convensions as Jekyll and should be compatible with basic Jekyll websites. If you are not familiar with Jekyll, have a read at https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Usage
