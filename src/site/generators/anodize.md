description: Generate modern pages from minimal source files.

Anodize exists because I was too lazy to learn how to use Jekyll. Its continuing mission: to boldly generate functional, SE-optimized websites from as little source data as possible.

Anodize currently powers Sid Mani's blog at [www.sidmani.com](https://www.sidmani.com).
