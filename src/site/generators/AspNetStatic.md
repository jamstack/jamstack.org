### Transform ASP.NET Core into a Static Site Generator

Use AspNetStatic to create a static website with the same ASP.NET Core tools you love and use every day. Just add the module and tell it which routes (page, css, js, etc.) to process.

AspNetStatic works equally well with Blazor (SSR), Razor Pages, and MVC (conrollers + views).

### No Frameworks. No Engines. No Opinions!

Build your ASP.NET site the way you always have. 
AspNetStatic doesn't have any opinions about how you should structure your server-rendered site. 
AspNetStatic is not a framework. It's not a CMS. There's no blog engine. It has no templating system. 
AspNetStatic does just one thing; create static files for selected routes in your ASP.NET Core project. 
That means you can use whatever framework, component, package, or architectural style you like. 
Want to use a blog engine? No problem. Want to use a CMS? No problem. Want to create a documentation site using a markdown processor to render page content? No problem! 
AspNetStatic doesn't care; it will **create optimized static files no matter how the content is produced by the server**.
