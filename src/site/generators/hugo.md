Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. It is optimized for
speed, easy use and configurability. Hugo takes a directory with content and
templates and renders them into a full html website.

Hugo makes use of Markdown files with front matter for meta data.

A typical website of moderate size can be
rendered in a fraction of a second. A good rule of thumb is that Hugo
takes around 1 millisecond for each piece of content.

It is written to work well with any
kind of website including blogs, tumbles and docs.
