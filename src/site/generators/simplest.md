description: The simplest static sitegen there is. Build a modern, fully working website using only HTML.
---
## Do you recognize this:

- You are comfortable with html and want to build a relatively simple, modern static site.
- You look at the jamstack site generators, but they always seem a bit too complicated. Too much configuration, too much scaffolding, too many themes, too much documentation.
- You don't want to get into all that *again*, because you have tested a few of them.

## Don't despair, the solution is in front of you!

Introducing **simplest**. It's true, it really is the simplest static sitegen, while still being quite able. 

Only HTML needed. No markdown, no yaml, no template languages, no huge documentation, and a one-step build process. 

## Support for

- Pure HTML templating
- Sass
- Automatic cache-busting
- Multiple templates
- Live reload dev server
- Highly configurable
- Plugins for parsing custom files
- Can optionally use PHP for easy server-side power

## Test it out

Take it for a spin immediately with 

`npm create simplest-sitegen`
