description: Fast, Scalable, and Flexible Static Site Generator written in Zig. Make art with your words.
---

Zine turns your content into HTML, styles it using your layouts, and finally copies the result into an output directory that you can then publish on static hosting services like GitHub Pages.

Zine uses a **structured approach to content authoring** that helps keeping sizeable content collections manageable.

Zine is implemented from scratch in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) and it’s so fast that it’s currently able to give you instant live updates when the development server is running, even though it rebuilds your entire site from scratch every time.
