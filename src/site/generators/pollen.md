description: A web book-publishing system written in Racket with static html as default output target.
---

A book-publishing system written in [Racket](https://racket-lang.org). This is the software used to publish & maintain the web-based books [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com), [Typography for Lawyers](https://typographyforlawyers.com), and the forthcoming [Beautiful Racket](https://beautifulracket.com).

If you think documents should be programmable, you’ll love it.  
If not, you can move along.

Pollen gives you access to a full programming language (Racket) with a text-based syntax that makes it easy to embed code within your documents.
