## Kontent by Kentico

Kontent by Kentico offers Content as a Service to gain full control over content presentation across all digital channels.

### Manage All Your Content in One Place

Organize your content in a cloud-based content hub where you can collaborate with your team.

### Display the Content on Your Website or Mobile Application

Use the super-fast REST API or GraphQL, both backed by Fastly CDN, to display your content on the web, in mobile apps, or on any device to come. Choose any programming language, leverage the native open-source SDKs with Fluent API, and write the code as you like it.

### Control Your Content Across the Production Process

Manage your content from planning through creation up to publishing and optimization.

### Static Site Generators

See examples of [static site generators using Kontent for Content as a Service](https://docs.kontent.ai/tutorials/develop-apps/optimize-your-app/static-sites).
