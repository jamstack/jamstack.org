## Sirius press
Sirius press is a set of high-end SaaS products built to overcome media digital challenges.

Our softwares signature is the proximity between techs and publishers teams which allow fast iterations and tailor-made product crafting.

Sirius was firstly built to match Le Monde newspaper publications' needs. The success of the application led us to use it for all Le Monde Group newsrooms and offer it outside the group's borders.
