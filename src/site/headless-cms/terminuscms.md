## TerminusCMS at a Glance

TerminusCMS is a [headless content management system](https://terminusdb.com). Under the hood is a JSON document-oriented knowledge graph made for developers to solve complex enterprise problems.

- Human and machine-readable JSON documents
- RDF graph database where the nodes are JSON for graph queries
- Change request workflows at the database layer
- User and team access and authentication at the database layer
- Git-like collaboration allows operations such as branch, clone, and merge 
- Immutable commit history - See the complete history of documents and see who changed what and when
- Datalog and GraphQL graph query
- Distributed design - Work locally and push and pull changes to the cloud
- Schema migration tools - Evolve and scale applications
- AI best practice - Graph relationships, metadata, and version control provide the backbone to use your content infrastructure to train AI and exploit the boom of artificial intelligence.
- Open Source
