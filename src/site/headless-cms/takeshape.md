### Infinitely Customizable Content Schema

Bring your own content model. Your content is unique to your product. TakeShape provides an easy to use drag-and-drop content modeling interface. 

### Be Creative

We built TakeShape to allow you to focus your time on building what matters, your product, not on worrying about all the infrastructure and headache that goes into running a CMS.
