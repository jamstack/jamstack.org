## DatoCMS
DatoCMS is the headless CMS that gets out of the way, so you can bring projects to life quickly and without unnecessary complexity.

### API-first

### Starter Projects!
DatoCMS comes with [**starter projects**](https://dashboard.datocms.com/projects/browse/categories?utm_source=headlesscms.org&utm_medium=project&utm_campaign=headlesscms.org) for Next.js, Nuxt, Svelte, and other frameworks. If you're new to DatoCMS, we recommend trying our [Marketing Website](https://www.datocms.com/marketplace/starters/marketing-website) or [E-commerce] (https://www.datocms.com/marketplace/starters/ecommerce-website) starters, which offer typed GraphQL queries, Tailwind, multi-language, Web Previews, real-time updates in Preview Mode, SEO/Readability analysis, and much more!

### GraphQL
The Content Delivery API is written in GraphQL, which offers a number of advantages over classic REST APIs:
- Strongly typed schema
- No more over-fetching and under-fetching
- Fewer roundtrips

### Features

### Modular content
Rich text fields, images, geopoints, complex relationships, SEO/social sharing settings... DatoCMS makes it easy to build a tailored authoring experience for your editors and marketers.
Create any kind of object — pages, products, case studies. Just drag and drop fields into your model and everything will be instantly editable.

### Powerful media manipulation
Every DatoCMS plan comes with the power of Imgix, an extremely powerful and fast CDN that allows you to perform any kind of manipulation to the uploaded assets. Optimize, resize, crop, rotate and watermark images on-the-fly simply adding custom parameters to the URL of your image.

### Dynamic layouts
With DatoCMS you can achieve structured, rich-content editing using a specific type of field called Modular Content.
Give your authors the freedom to compose inspiring visual stories by alternating a number of reusable custom components without depending on their developers.

### 100% Whitelabel
Customize theme colors, logo, custom domain.. you can easily setup DatoCMS to match your — or your clients' — brand identity.

### Multi-language
DatoCMS offers full localization support. All your content types and assets can be localizable, including rich text, images, geopoints and especially your URLs. We also provide 

### Tree-like structures
Taxonomies, product categories, navigation bars... websites are full of hierarchical data. DatoCMS is the only headless CMS that supports tree-like data structures out-of-the-box, offering a delightful editing experience for your editors and marketers.

### Customizable navigation bar
When your website gets bigger, the number of models in your administrative area will grow as well, so for editors it might quickly become difficult to understand which part of the backend is linked to which part of the frontend website. With DatoCMS you can easily organize the navigation bar of your administrative area: group, rename and reorder menu items so that their purpose will be more clear to your editors.

### User roles
Simply put, DatoCMS offers the most thorough roles/permissions system you can find in the headless CMS market.
Build the perfect publication workflow for your team, precisely determining what actions every team member can perform inside the administrative area (ie. "user has read-only permissions on every content, except for articles which can be freely created/updated but not deleted nor published online").

### Content Versioning
Never lose a change thanks to revision history: DatoCMS keeps track of all drafts and publications of your content, in a simple concise view, displayed together with the change date and its author. DatoCMS offers a powerful diff visualization of changes between content revisions.
