## Coisas

Browse, view, edit, create and delete any kind of file.

Markdown files are shown with a ProseMirror based editor and YAML frontmatter is abstracted into a nice metadata
editing form. Images from the repository are shown on the side so they can be dragged to the post and easy
drag-and-drop image upload features are provided.

Any GitHub repo can have its files edited by **Coisas**, but it gets better if you customize the repo by adding a
`coisas.js` file to its root. You can configure the GitHub authorization handler, the colors, the file defaults,
set up a preview method and more.
