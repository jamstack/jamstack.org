# Why Flycode?

[FlyCode](https://www.flycode.com/) is the only out-of-the-box CMS built specifically for Modern Web and Mobile Applications. 
- There is zero development work required to spin up or maintain
- FlyCode automatically scans your code to identify content and makes it editable via their pre-built UI 
- Maintain codebase ownership with a git-based workflow that treats content as a feature
- Bridge the gap between Developers and Product/UX stakeholders to ship product edits faster without all the back-and-forth
- Saved precious development time and approve changes instead of doing them yourself!


# How it works?

#### Connect your app 
Visit [our app](https://www.flycode.com/developers), to connect your apps, select relevant repos - or add your teammate and send them an invite to connect!
That's it, FlyCode does the rest! Immediately access your content to begin editing with no code!

#### Empower Product and UX teams to own experimentation and product edits without development resources:
FlyCode's automated scan identifies editable components and content in the product and submits requests for changes via a pull request for the developers to review.
Defining a new category of No-Codeâ€¦ using your code ðŸ¤¯

#### Developers approve changes through Git, matching their existing workflow:
For each change requested via FlyCode, a Pull Request (or Merge Request) will be sent to the developers in the same way they would do it themselves.
Our visual editor (beta) helps non-developers visualize changes with the context of the UI.
