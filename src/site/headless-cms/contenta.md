## Contenta is a decoupled Drupal 8 distribution

Contenta is the community driven API distribution for Drupal 8, and provides the robustness and flexibility of Drupal in a friendly API-first package.

It provides a standard platform that is API ready along with demo content and example front-end applications. Contenta intends to ease the pain of using, or simply trying, decoupled Drupal.

## Free Open Source Software to be hosted anywhere

Contenta is based off of Drupal, which is a powerful, robust content management system built on object-oriented PHP. Drupal runs websites such as whitehouse.gov, grammy.com, harvard.edu, and millions more.

## API ready with excellent documentation.

A HTTP API is provided ready to use with full auto-generated documentation, and a Contenta knowledge hub is manually curated to provide a list of excellent resources on decoupled Drupal.

## Example (and Open Source) API Consumers

Many example consumers in different technologies such as Angular, Elm, React, Ember, Ionic, and Vue show you how easy is to build a Contenta project.
