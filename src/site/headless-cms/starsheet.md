# Starsheet

Use Google Sheets as a low-cost, headless CMS, with zero infrastructure to manage but published to your AWS account so you're in control of your data.

## Features

- **Edit using Google Sheets** - Use a familiar editor that's flexible enough to evolve with your project. Need a new field? Simply add a column to the spreadsheet.
- **Published to your AWS account** - You're in control of your data, removing the risk of a 3rd party service shutting down and impacting your app.  
- **No infrastructure to manage** - Starsheet can set up everything automatically on your AWS account, and there's nothing that requires ongoing maintenance.
- **Handles images + structured data** - Build complex data structures including objects and arrays and images from the spreadsheet are automatically published along with the data
- **Environments + Version Control** - Starsheet creates a robust publishing workflow that allows you to iterate and test in isolation from your live project, with full history and rollbacks.
- **Extremely low hosting costs** - Startsheet doesn't charge or restrict plans based on usage. You pay AWS data transfer costs directly so there's no markup and you can take advantage of AWS free usage allowances.
