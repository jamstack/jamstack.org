## Content. Preview. Go Live.

doc2.site is an API-first cloud-native service with intuitive content authoring based on Google Drive, Docs and Sheets built to power the future of Web Experiences.

Publish content as structured data to any platform or device instantly and deliver across the web close to your users.

### Increase content velocity

doc2.site helps non-technical authors to increase content velocity, while allowing developers to iterate quickly pushing new features out at the same time.

By using Google Drive, Docs, and Sheets, doc2.site is able to easily integrate with the tools that many users are already familiar with. This makes it easier for users to create and manage their content.

Leverage AI models like Chat GPT and Dall-E to naturally generate written and media content such as blog articles or product descriptions and integrate it naturally into Google Docs.

## API-first. Fast. Easy.

Our HTTP API gives you control over your content stored in the Google Drive folder. Create files, work with Documents and Spreadsheets to deliver content with our Edge network.

The published content is headless which allows different architecture parts to be composed with doc2.site to build a custom and unique solution to fit your requirements.

### Unstructured and structured content

Unstructured content stored in Google Docs is transformed into Structured Content powered by the open-source Unified ecosystem.

First, any representation data in the content is stripped off then the content is structured into smaller reasonable pieces. Delivered is hast for consumption by developers ranging from beginners to experts for any type of application. References can be linked together to build reusable content following the write once, use everywhere mantra.  

Structured content in Google Sheets is parsed and represented as data models delivered in JSON format. Authors can link Spreadsheets in Documents to express relations of unstructured content with structured content and vice versa. For example, in the context of a restaurant, an author can store the menu with price, description etc. in a Spreadsheet and link it to a Menu Document.

Filter and query content by leveraging the powerful JSON query language JMESPath via our API on any published JSON content. For documents, use the more natural DOM query selector to retrieve fragments of content.
