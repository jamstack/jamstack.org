## CrafterCMS

Headless CMSs were built for developers, and have unleashed higher levels of developer productivity. However, they leave the content authoring teams with a limited UX. CrafterCMS improves on this by enabling your entire team of content authors, software developers, and DevOps to innovate faster and collaborate better. 

Developers get an open source, API-first platform to build all types of sites and apps using any front-end and server-side technology, while content authors get an easy to use visual editing and drag/drop composable experience. All built around generative AI technologies and a Git-based content repository that raises enterprise productivity through unique DevContentOps processes. 

For composing fast, secure and scalable content-centric digital experiences.

## Architecture
Truly decoupled architecture with separate content authoring system and content delivery systems, both of which are API-first platforms. 

The CrafterCMS content delivery platform is a Java/Spring app with no external database dependencies, serverless and stateless for high reliability, elastic scalability, high throughput, and ultra-security. All front-end technologies are fully supported (React, Angular, Next, etc.), and also includes server-side rendering support with FreeMarker. OpenSearch and Groovy scripting fully supported as well.

The CrafterCMS content authoring platform, also a Java/Spring application, is built around Git for content storage/versioning/branching and supporting DevContentOps processes. The content authoring application (React-based) provides a user-friendly content authoring experience (WYSIWYG editing, in-context editing, live preview, drag/drop experience building).
