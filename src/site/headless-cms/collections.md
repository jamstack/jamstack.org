## Why Collections?

The complexity of migration stands as a significant obstacle in embracing the new CMS. To address this, Collections incorporates a migration tool within the CMS. This streamlines the process, allowing you to effortlessly import posts exported from WordPress.

Moreover, by releasing the script as open source, we are migrating away from WordPress with its diverse data structures. Constructive contributions that allow migration to any data are welcome.
