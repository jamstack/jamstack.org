## What is Contento?

Contento is a modern headless CMS 100% focused on websites.

## Who is Contento For?

Contento offers the perfect balance of simple content management paired with powerful content modeling - loved by both the content team and devs alike. Unlike some of our competitors who aggressively ramp pricing, we offer a straight-forward pricing structure that is not designed to price gouge.

We also bake in key features like SEO and visual preview across all product tiers enabling all users to access the entire feature set. Reusable content blocks also help to speed up page build times enabling the marketing team to optimize workflows independent of developers.

Finally, we assume you are using Contento to manage and maintain a website. This simple assumption frees us to add features aligned with this goal, which we think is one of the dominant use cases for most headless deployments.
