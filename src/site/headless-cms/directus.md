## Core Principles

Directus is a simple solution for complex problems, with a data-first approach guided by the following core principles:

* **Pure** — No predefined or proprietary schema, with all system metadata stored separately
* **Open** — Public and transparent codebase with no obfuscated or cloud-only code
* **Portable** — Database can be exported or migrated at any time with no vendor lock-in
* **Limitless** — No artificial limitations or paywalls on users, roles, languages, collections, or items
* **Extensible** — Every aspect of the platform is modular to avoid any hard feature ceilings
* **Unopinionated** — Choose your stack, database, and architecture; self-hosted or on cloud

## Database Mirroring

**Directus is installed as a layer on top of your new or existing SQL database, with its App and API dynamically “mirroring” your actual schema and content in real-time.** This approach is similar to how technical database clients (like _phpMyAdmin_) work, however Directus provides an experience that is safe, intuitive, and powerful enough for anyone... even the most non-technical users.

Database mirroring has many unique advantages:

* Control over your pure SQL database schema, tailored to your exact requirements
* Significant performance improvements through optimizations and indexing
* Complete transparency, portability, and security for your data
* Direct database access and the full power of raw/complex SQL queries
* Allows importing existing databases, unaltered and without any migrations

Other platforms typically use a predefined or proprietary “one-size-fits-all” data model to store your content (have you ever peeked behind the curtain of a WordPress installation? Yikes!). That is not the case with Directus. Directus gives you direct access to your pure and unaltered data. That means you have the option to bypass the Directus middleware (API, SDK, App) and connect to your data with proper SQL queries. This effectively removes all bottlenecks, latency overhead, and proprietary access limitations.

## Multilingual Content & Internationalization

Directus allows you to manage multilingual content in as many languages as your project needs. And no matter what language(s) your organization requires, our Admin App supports a growing number of locales. We've also paid close attention to our Admin App's interface to ensure it is as clear and accessible as possible for all users.
