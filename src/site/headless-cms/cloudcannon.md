## Cloud Cannon
The Cloud CMS for Jekyll - build Jekyll or static websites, have your team and clients update inline.

### Easy Editing
Update content directly on the page. There's no guessing how changes appear on the live site.

Developers control what clients update by adding a class of editable to HTML elements.

### Editable Hydra
Structure content
Build smart structures with front matter to make even the most complex data updatable.

Photo galleries, background images and metadata are all powerful ways to use front matter.

### Editable Hydra
Sync with Git
Work in your local environment then sync files using GitHub, Bitbucket or Dropbox.

Content changes made on CloudCannon also sync back to your repository or Dropbox.

### Editable Hydra
The tools you love
Build sites using Jekyll, Liquid, Sass and any CSS or JavaScript frameworks you like.

Write your own Ruby to extend Jekyll with CloudCannon Jekyll plugin support.

### Editable Hydra
Live, scalable and secure
CloudCannon builds your sites, optimises assets to ensure peak performance, then publishes them live on CloudCannon hosting.
