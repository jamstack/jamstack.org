## A headless CMS that’s great for content authors and a joy for developers

Contensis is an API-first accessible CMS, designed to give your authors the ability to focus on modelling and creating reusable content, while offering developers total flexibility in their approach to development.

## Blocks

Contensis is different from most API-first platforms as it offers the ability to deliver your site using a technology we call Blocks. Blocks are self-contained packages of code, related dependencies, and configuration files needed to run them. You can push them to Contensis using our CLI.

Blocks are effectively containers, much like those created and used behind the scenes on platforms like AWS, but we provide the Hosting, the management and deployment of Blocks, and the ability to realise continuous delivery without the need for large dev-ops teams.

## Site View

Site View allows you to structure a site in a familiar tree-like manner. Users simply attach content entries to a node in Site View to assign them to an SEO-friendly URL.

It supports polymorphic relationships while allowing users to set a canonical URL for content.

## Elasticsearch

With every Contensis instance you get a full Elasticsearch cluster – meaning you don’t need to maintain a separate search platform.

## Content governance for multilingual teams

Contensis lets you create and manage content in over 50 languages, allowing teams to work on complex multinational websites and apps through one interface. A sophisticated roles and permissions system allows you to specify what content and languages users can manage – ensuring authors will only see content relevant to them.

## Integrating with Contensis

Creating and updating content is quick and easy through the Management API. With Contensis you can effortlessly migrate content from your existing CMS or content repository and quickly integrate with other systems like intranets, e-commerce catalogues and research portals. The ability to reverse proxy your old site, whilst serving new content structured through our Delivery API, is available out of the box.

## Use your favourite languages and frameworks

Contensis is language agnostic, allowing you to work in React, Angular, or whatever framework you like. A set of RESTful APIs are provided with language wrappers for JavaScript and .NET, along with comprehensive documentation to help get you started.

Contensis is as frictionless and simple to use as you would expect a modern CMS to be, with features such as custom workflows, webhooks and real-time messaging to ensure you can deliver the most demanding websites and single-page apps.
