# Sveltia CMS

Sveltia CMS is a Git-based lightweight headless CMS under active
development as a modern, quick replacement for Netlify CMS and Decap
CMS.

In some simple cases, migration is as easy as a single line of code
change, although we’re still working on improving compatibility.

The free, open source, UX-focused alternative to Netlify/Decap CMS is
now in public beta — with more features to come.

# Motivation

Sveltia CMS was born in November 2022, when the progress of Netlify CMS was stalled for more than six months. @kyoshino’s clients wanted to replace their Netlify CMS instances without much effort, mainly to get better internationalization (i18n) support.

To achieve radical improvements in UX, performance and i18n, it was decided to build an alternative from the ground up, while ensuring an easy migration path from the other. After proving the concept with a rapid Svelte prototype, development was accelerated to address their primary use cases. The new offering has since been named Sveltia CMS and released as open source software to encourage wider adoption.

Our goal is to make it a viable successor to Netlify CMS, expand the Git-based headless CMS market, empower small businesses and individuals who need a simple yet powerful CMS solution, and showcase the huge potential of the Svelte framework.
