  <h2>Why Jamstack</h2>
  <p class="w-2/3 mb-12">
    The Jamstack architecture has many benefits, whether you’re building a large e-commerce site, SaaS application or personal blog.

      "#pink_lightning",
      "<p>
        Why wait for pages to build on the fly when you can generate them at deploy time? When it comes to minimizing the time to first byte, nothing beats pre-built files served over a CDN.
      </p>")

  {{ section.benefit(
      "Higher Security",
      "#blue_shield",
      "<p>
        With server-side processes abstracted into microservice APIs, surface areas for attacks are reduced. You can also leverage the domain expertise of specialist third-party services.
      </p>")
  }}
  {{ section.benefit(
    "Cheaper, Easier Scaling",
    "#orange_coins",
    "<p>
      When your deployment amounts to a stack of files that can be served anywhere, scaling is a matter of serving those files in more places. CDNs are perfect for this, and often include scaling in all of their plans.
    </p>")
  }}
  {{ section.benefit(
    "Better Developer Experience",
    "#teal_browser",
    "<p>
      Loose coupling and separation of controls allow for more targeted development and debugging, and the expanding selection of CMS options for site generators remove the need to maintain a separate stack for content and marketing.

    <p class="mt-6 mb-8">
      Jamstack is the new standard architecture for the web. Using Git workflows and modern build tools, pre-rendered   content is served to a CDN and made dynamic through APIs and serverless functions. Technologies in the stack include JavaScript frameworks, Static Site Generators, Headless CMSs, and CDNs.
