  <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
  <p>
   Jamstack is an inclusive philosophy and an inclusive community.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Welcome!</h2>
  <p>
    We strive to create a friendly, welcoming, judgement- and harassment-free place for individuals to learn, connect, and grow together.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are a diverse, global community. We have members from every gender, sexuality, gender expression, race, ethnicity, tribal background, religious affiliation, citizenship and nationality, age, physical ability, educational background, experience level that you can think of - and want everyone to feel welcome!
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether it is contributing to our website, connecting in our Discord, or attending conferences and independently organized meetings, it's not only our hope, but our expectation, that you'll abide by these three basic ground rules:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc list-outside pl-4 my-4">
    <li class="mb-4">
      <h3 class="dark:text-white font-bold inline">We approach interactions with thoughtfulness and care.</h3>
        We are patient & kind to others. We don't dismiss someone because they have a different level of experience, are of a different background, or have a difference of opinion than us.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-4">
      <h3 class="dark:text-white font-bold inline">We are respectful when we disagree with someone.</h3>
        There is a human in front of us. We donâ€™t allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We are collectively responsible for each other.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-4">
      <h3 class="dark:text-white font-bold inline">We work to correct mistakes when they occur.</h3>
        No one is expected to always be perfect or to know everything - sometimes even good intentions have unwanted outcomes. But how we respond to criticism is important. If someone criticizes our conduct, or points out ways we have harmed someone, we listen without taking it personally, and work towards a resolution - together.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="mb-6">We will not tolerate the following:</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-outside pl-4 mb-4">
    <li>Violent threats or language.</li>
    <li>Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language.</li>
    <li>Disrespecting people's stated pronouns and gender identity, or current name.</li>
    <li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
    <li>Posting, or threatening to post, people's personally identifying information ("doxing").</li>
    <li>Insults, especially those using discriminatory terms or slurs.</li>
    <li>Behavior that could be perceived as sexual attention.</li>
    <li>Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.</li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc list-outside pl-4 my-4">
    <li><h3 class="dark:text-white font-bold inline">In the moment:</h3> Are you safe? If not, get to a safe place. Can you talk to someone you trust about what happened?</li>
    <li><h3 class="dark:text-white font-bold inline">As soon as possible:</h3> evaluate the situation - is it safe to talk to the person directly about this incident?
      <ul class="list-disc list-outside pl-4 my-4">
        <li><h3 class="dark:text-white font-bold inline">If it seems safe</h3>, try and speak with the person privately, <b>in person</b> if you can. Try and work to a resolution together. If it goes well, great! If it does not go well, please speak to an organizer as soon as you can.
        <li> <h3 class="dark:text-white font-bold inline">If it does not seem safe</h3>, or the conversation did not go well, speak to an organizer about what happened as soon as you can.</li>
      </ul>
