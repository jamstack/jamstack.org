  - title: Be considerate
    description: Approach your interactions with thoughtfulness and care. Do not dismiss someone because they have a different level of experience, are of a different background, or have a difference of opinion. Be kind to others.
  - title: Be respectful
    description: Disagreement is not an excuse for poor manners. We don't allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
  - title: Take responsibility for your words and actions
    description: We all make mistakes. If someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully, and work to right the wrong.
