jamstack: "**JAMstack**: noun &#92;’jam-stak’&#92; <span><br></span>Modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup."
explanation: When we talk about "The Stack," we no longer talk about operating systems, specific web servers, backend programming languages, or databases.<br><br>The JAMstack is not about specific technologies. It's a new way of building websites and apps that delivers better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and a better developer experience.

javascript: "Any dynamic programming during the request/response cycle is handled by JavaScript, running entirely on the client. This could be any frontend framework, library, or even vanilla JavaScript."
apis: "All server-side processes or database actions are abstracted into reusable APIs, accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript. These can be custom-built or leverage third-party services."
markup: "Templated markup should be prebuilt at deploy time, usually using a site generator for content sites, or a build tool for web apps.<br><br>[Want to see some examples?](/examples)"

disqualifications:
  - disqualification: A site built with a server-side CMS like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, or Squarespace.
  - disqualification: A monolithic server-run web app that relies on Ruby, Node, or another backend language.
  - disqualification: A single page app that uses isomorphic rendering to build views on the server at runtime.

advantages:
  - advantage: Better Performance
    description: Why wait for pages to build on the fly when you can generate them at deploy time? When it comes to minimizing the time to first byte, nothing beats pre-built files served over a CDN.
  - advantage: Higher Security
    description: With server-side processes abstracted into microservice APIs, surface areas for attacks are reduced. You can also leverage the domain expertise of specialist third-party services.
  - advantage: Cheaper, Easier Scaling
    description: When your deployment amounts to a stack of files that can be served anywhere, scaling is a matter of serving those files in more places. CDNs are perfect for this, and often include scaling in all of their plans.
  - advantage: Better Developer Experience
    description: Loose coupling and separation of controls allow for more targeted development and debugging, and the expanding selection of CMS options for site generators remove the need to maintain a separate stack for content and marketing.
