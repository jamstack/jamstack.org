    <h4>Reporting</h4>
      If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior—or have any other concerns—please report it by contacting the meetup organizer. Should you need more support or are not getting your concerns addressed locally, please reach out to Netlify Community Manager Perry Eising - perry@netlify.com.
      All reports will be handled with discretion - we will not disclose your name or any other identifying information without prior consent. In your report please include:
      <ul>
        <li>Your contact information.</li>
        <li>Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved, if they are known to you.</li>
        <li>If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well, and let us know if they gave consent to be contacted.</li>
        <li>Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing.</li>
        <li>Any additional information that may be helpful.</li>
      </ul>
      After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally, review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. If the complaint originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a different member of the response team. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.
